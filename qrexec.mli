type handler = user:string -> string -> Flow.flow -> int Lwt.t
(** A handler gets a command-line and a two-way connection to the requesting client each time
    the remote client sends a MSG_EXEC_CMDLINE request. The "exit code" from the handler
    is returned to the client. *)

val connect : domid:int -> unit -> t Lwt.t
(** [connect ~domid ()] is a qrexec agent to which a client in [domid] has connected.
    Internally, it creates a server endpoint and places the endpoint information
    in XenStore, then waits for a client to connect. *)

val listen :  t -> handler -> unit Lwt.t
(** [listen t handler] is a thread that reads incoming requests from [t]
    and handles each one asynchronously with [handler]. The loop ends if
    the client disconnects. *)

val disconnect : t -> unit Lwt.t
(** Close the underlying vchan. This will cause any listening thread to finish. *)
